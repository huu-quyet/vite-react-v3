### Pain point
### Advantages
1. Uniformity
- The code is organized by scope of influence (layers), by domain (slices), and by technical purpose (segments).
This creates a standardized architecture that is easy to comprehend for newcomers.
2. Controlled reuse of logic
- Each architectural component has its purpose and predictable dependencies.
This keeps a balance between following the DRY principle and adaptation possibilities.
3. Stability in face of changes and refactoring
- A module on a particular layer cannot use other modules on the same layer, or the layers above.
This enables isolated modifications without unforeseen consequences.
4. Orientation to business and users needs
- When the app is split into business domains, you can navigate the code to discover and deeper understand all the project features.
